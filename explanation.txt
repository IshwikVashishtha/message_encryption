Explanation:
1 } Encryption Function (complexEncryption):

XOR each character of the input text with the key.
Shift each character by 3 positions.
Encode the result using Base64.


2 } Decryption Function (complexDecryption):

Decode the Base64 string.
Reverse the character shift by subtracting 3 positions.
XOR each character with the key to retrieve the original text.


3 } HTML Structure:

Input fields for entering text to encrypt and decrypt.
Buttons to trigger encryption and decryption.
Output area to display the results.


4 } Event Listeners:

Added event listeners to the buttons to call the encryption and decryption functions and display the results.
